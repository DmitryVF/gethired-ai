We've come really close because we aren't growing the team with 'lone wolves', but developers who want to learn something new, who want to share that knowledge with others and who are ready to jump into that problem-solving mode whenever they encounter any kind of challenge. And, of course, have fun while they're doing it!",

And if their primary stack of PHP with Symfony, MySQL and JavaScript aren't enough to crack the issue, they'll learn a new language & use new tech - anything that'll make their job easier and themselves more proficient."
